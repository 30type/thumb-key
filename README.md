## About Thumb-Key

Thumb-Key is a _privacy-conscious_ smart keyboard, made specifically for your thumbs.

It features a 9-key grid layout, as many old-school phones had, and uses swipes for the less common letters. Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a few days of use.

Instead of relying on spying word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular smartphone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses larger keys with predictable positions, around a central hub key (the middle of the grid), to prevent your eyes from hunting for letters.

This project is a follow-up to the now dead (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration.
